**Postmortem: Web Service Outage - April 10, 2024**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** April 10, 2024, 10:30 AM - April 10, 2024, 12:00 PM (UTC-5)
- **Impact:** Our primary web service experienced intermittent downtime, affecting approximately 30% of our users, leading to degraded performance and service interruptions.

**Root Cause:**
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, resulting in uneven distribution of traffic and increased server load on specific instances.

**Timeline:**
- **10:30 AM:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts showing increased latency.
- **10:40 AM:** Engineers began investigating; initial assumption was a database performance issue.
- **10:50 AM:** Misleading investigation into database performance led to dead-end.
- **11:00 AM:** Incident escalated to senior SysAdmin team.
- **11:15 AM:** Load balancer misconfiguration identified as root cause.
- **11:30 AM:** Load balancer settings corrected; traffic evenly redistributed.
- **12:00 PM:** Service fully restored; monitoring confirms stable performance.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The misconfiguration in the load balancer led to certain servers receiving disproportionate traffic, causing slowdowns and intermittent outages. This was resolved by correcting the load balancing algorithm settings to evenly distribute incoming requests across all available servers.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated load balancer configuration checks to prevent similar misconfigurations.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect load imbalances and latency spikes in real-time.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Implement automated load balancer health checks and configuration drift alerts.
  - Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings and configurations.
  - Develop runbook for troubleshooting load balancer-related incidents.
  
This postmortem provides a comprehensive overview of the recent web service outage, detailing its impact, root cause, resolution, and actionable steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.
